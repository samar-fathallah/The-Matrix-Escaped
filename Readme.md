The Matrix: Escaped
The year is 2200 and the machines took over the world after a long and grueling battle
the likes of which were never seen before. Most of humanity was defeated and they got
their memories erased and then put into deep sleep. In this state, their brains are used
as a huge neural network by the machines. To harness the power of the humans’ brains,
the machines created a simulation called the matrix where humans who are asleep think
that in fact they are alive in. After the war, a very few number of humans were able to
escape the wrath of the machines and they started planning how to avenge their loss and
save the human race. A prophecy was told that there will come someone from within the
matrix who will be the chosen savior of humanity. This person is called Neo. The living
were able to get to the matrix and they were able to locate Neo and get him finally
awake. Now, Neo get in and out of the matrix when he can to save other humans.

Neo’s goal is to take as many
humans as possible alive to a special location called the telephone booth where they can
get out of the matrix. However, if hostages die and turn into agents, Neo would have to
kill these agents. Further, if a hostage dies while being carried by Neo, Neo would also
return it to the telephone booth so that the body would not become an agent in the future.

The following search
strategies were implemented to help Neo:
a) Breadth-first search.
b) Depth-first search.
c) Iterative deepening search.
d) Uniform-cost search.
e) Greedy search with at least two heuristics.
f) A* search with at least two admissible heuristics.
